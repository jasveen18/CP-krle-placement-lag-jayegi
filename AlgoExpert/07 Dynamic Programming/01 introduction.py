# Those who can't remember their past are condemned to repeat it.

# Remember what you have solved already and build on top of it.

# Used in -
#   1. Optimal Substructure - Bigger problem expressed as smaller sub-problems.
#                               Example - Merge Sort, sum(6) = sum(5) + 1
#   2. Overlapping Subproblem - Retreiving values that are already computed before.
#                               Example - Fibonacci
